# Background on the Kwite Name
To be totally honest, the name "kwite" came completely by backing into it.
A Kwite is backed by [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) and
they are quite programmable and integrable. The intent was to create a modern,
pure Kubernetes driven web server and ignore pretty much everything else. So it
was sort of a 'back-in' to find a way to stick a 'K' out front and let the word
still sound like 'quite'. Kwite, after all that, came from "Kubernetes Web
Integrated Template Engine" and that worked! Backed-in or not, Kwite is Kwite a
small, yet infinitely scalable, web server (to the extent Kubernetes is so
scalable.
